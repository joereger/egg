## Introduction

Egg is a bash-based deployment and management system, developed at a time when modern orchestration tools like Puppet and Chef were either non-existent or not yet mature. It serves as a testament to the power of automation and configuration, especially in a cloud-based environment.

## Background

In the early days, managing 30ish applications across approximately 20 physical servers in a datacenter was a daunting task. It involved late-night runs to fix hardware issues, reinstall operating systems, and a fair amount of cursing at the moon. The advent of Amazon AWS was revolutionary, allowing for server management via code.

Egg originated as a humble bash script designed to automate the process of firing up a new server. Over time, it evolved to include features like heartbeat checks, deployment automation, and more. 

There's no signifigance to the name beyond the fact that I knew I'd be typing it into a console a lot.  I wanted something short and sweet.

## Features

- **Heartbeat Checks**: Monitors the health of servers and services.
- **Deployment Automation**: Streamlines the process of deploying codebases across multiple instances.
- **Error Detection**: Identifies issues at the server, service, and system levels.
- **Self-Healing**: Capable of tearing down problematic components and spinning them back up.
- **Configuration-Driven**: All logical definitions for the cluster are kept in a minimal set of configuration files.

## Technologies Managed

Egg is versatile enough to manage a diverse set of technologies, including but not limited to:

- **Apache HTTP Servers**: For web hosting and load balancing.
- **Tomcat App Servers**: For running Java-based web applications.
- **MySQL Databases**: For relational data storage.
- **Terracotta Key/Value Cache Servers**: For fast data retrieval.
- **MongoDB Databases**: For NoSQL data storage.

## Lessons Learned

The development of Egg was not just a journey through bash scripting and Linux system administration. It was a deep dive into the transformative power of configuration when coupled with cloud servers. The system forced a level of functional clarity by eliminating redundant or "silly" code, thereby improving the overall quality of the technology stack.

## Evolution of DevOps

The success of Egg was a precursor to the rise of Platform as a Service (PaaS) solutions like Heroku, and the maturation of configuration management tools like Puppet and Chef. It also paved the way for containerization technologies like Docker.

---

## Conclusion

Egg serves as a historical yet still relevant example of how focused investments in automation can drive technology to conform to functional and improved outcomes. While bash scripts may lack the nuance of modern DevOps tools, they offer a level of simplicity and directness that is both educational and, at times, surprisingly effective.
